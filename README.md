# constrain
update contrains from given SINEX among minimum constrains (MC), over constrains (OC) and loose constrains (LS). This tool is useful if removal of the constrain or change of the constrain are required during the processing of the Terrestial reference frame solution.

This tool is consist of three parts 
1. I/O with SINEX file
2. convert between type of constrains
3. visualization tools for the fiducial sites

For the mathematical discription please refer to the paper "Revisiting the transformation ...".

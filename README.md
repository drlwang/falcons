# constrain
update contrains from given SINEX among minimum constrains (MC), over constrains (OC) and loose constrains (LS). This tool is useful if removal or change of the constrain are required during the processing of the Terrestial Reference Frame (TRF).

This tool is consist of three parts 
1. I/O with SINEX file
2. convert between types of constrains
3. visualization tools for the fiducial sites

For the mathematical discription please refer to the paper "Revisiting the transformation ..." in submission, this program can be open-accessed as soon as the paper is accepted.
The major scope of this program is to avoid the re-production of the normal equaiton and computation with heavy computational effort to convert constrains, instead, by inverting a small matrix.
